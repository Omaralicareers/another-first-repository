## The Notes

*Some of my notes that I will be updating here and there in case I forget anything*

use \## in front of words to make bold title

Using \*\* with any text in between will make *italicized*

Double it and it makes texts **bold**

Triple is and it makes texts ***bold and italicized***

Quadruple it and is doesnt make anything \*\*\*\*see\*\*\*\*

1:5 gives u every number between 1 and 5

as.numeric(c("1","2","3")) converts those "texts" back into numerical numbers so "1" will be a text and 1 will be a numeric

rep(0,11) means 0 is made 11 times

```{r} 

"ctrl+alt+I makes this little section"

```
```{r}
