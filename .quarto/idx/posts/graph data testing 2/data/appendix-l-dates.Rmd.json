{"title":"Dates and Times","markdown":{"headingText":"Dates and Times","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWorking with dates can be a little tricky, but the `r pkg(\"lubridate\", \"https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/\")` package is there to help. Their website has a helpful [cheatsheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/lubridate.pdf) and you can view a tutorial by typing `vignette(\"lubridate\")` in the console pane. This appendix is a quick intro to some of the most useful functions for making reproducible reports.\n\n```{r setup, message=FALSE}\n# packages needed for this appendix\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n## Parsing\n\nDates can be in many formats. The `ymd` functions can deal with almost all of them, regardless of the punctuation used in the format. All of the examples below produce a date in the standard format \"2022-01-03\".\n\n```{r ymd, results='hide'}\n# year-month-day orders\nymd(\"22 Jan 3\")\nymd(\"2022 January 3rd\")\n\n# month-day-year orders\nmdy(\"January 3, 2022\")\nmdy(\"Jan/03/22\")\n\n# day-month-year orders\ndmy(\"3JAN22\")\ndmy(\"3rd of January in the year 2022\")\n```\n\n::: {.try data-latex=\"\"}\nSee if you can make a date format that one of the parsers *can't* handle.\n:::\n\nThere are similar functions for date/times, too.\n\n```{r ymd-hms}\nymd_hms(\"2022 Jan 3, 6:05 and 20s pm\")\nmdy_h(\"January 3rd, 2022 at 6pm\")\n```\n\nThe date/time functions can also take a timezone argument. If you don't specify it, it defaults to \"UTC\".\n\n```{r tz}\nymd_hm(\"2022-01-03 18:05\", tz = \"GMT\", )\n```\n\n## Get Parts\n\nYou frequently need to extract parts of a date/time for plotting. Let's work through some examples with tweets from Appendix\\ \\@ref(twitter-data).\n\n```{r, message=FALSE}\ntweets <- list.files(\n  path = \"data/tweets\", \n  pattern = \"^tweet_activity_metrics\",\n  full.names = TRUE\n) %>%\n  map_df(read_csv) %>%\n  select(!starts_with(\"promoted\"))\n```\n\nThe `time` column is already in date/time (POSIXct) format, but what if we wanted to plot tweets by hour for each day of the week? The following functions extract specific parts of a date or datetime object: `second()`, `minute()`, `hour()`, `day()`, `wday()`, `yday()`, `week()`, `month()`, `year()`, and `tz()`.\n\n```{r weekday-tweets}\ntweets %>%\n  mutate(weekday = wday(time, label = TRUE),\n         hour = hour(time)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hour, color = weekday)) +\n  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)\n```\n\nThis is a godsend for people (like Lisa) who never have a clue what week of the year it is today.\n\n```{r}\ntoday() %>% week()\n```\n\nA nice side-effect of using the lubridate function to get days of the week or months of the year is that the results are an ordered factor, so display correctly in a plot.\n\n```{r month-tweets}\ntweets %>%\n  mutate(month = month(time, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = month, fill = month)) +\n  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=2))\n```\n\n\n## Internationalisation\n\nYou may need to work with dates from a different locale than your computer's defaults, such as dates written in French or Russian. Or your computer may have a non-English locale. Set the `locale` argument to the relevant language code.\n\n```{r}\nymd(\"2022 January 3\", locale = \"en_GB\")\nymd(\"2022 Janvier 3\", locale = \"fr_FR\")\nwday(\"2022-01-03\", label = TRUE, locale = \"ru_RU\")\n```\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n# check which locales are available on your computer\n# doesn't work for Windows\nsystem(\"locale -a\")\n```\n\n## Exercises\n\nWhat day of the week is/was your 50th birthday?\n\n```{r, webex.hide = TRUE}\nbirthdate <- ymd(19761118) # put your own birthdate here\nbirthday50 <- birthdate + years(50)\nwday(birthday50, label = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"output-file":"appendix-l-dates.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
