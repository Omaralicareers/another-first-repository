My initial thoughts.

I followed the steps as were shown on the video on <https://www.crumplab.com> but I ran into a problem on downloading a package that wasnt on my computer despite all the updates.

No worries, I got it downloaded when I searched it up on pacages and it was there and the quarto blog popped up and it works.

I edited the blog and made my own post and wondered if gifs are possible since I think they're considered an image. I am very glad that it works. I also didnt expect that if I typed the actual title of the gif that I gave it would actually show but, it did and even though its small I was very excited about it. Now im wondering if emojis work.
